##Jammming

##Jammming is a CodeAcademy portfolio project.

. The aim of this project was to show my knowlage of React, and JSX, i have spent less than a month familiarising myself with React.
. I have had a few difficulties with this project, however i feel they have made me better.
. It is not complete as I am unable to get hold of an access token on Spotify and will not be able to check the progress of my code as I progress.
. It is possible I may return to this project at a later date.
